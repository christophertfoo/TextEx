## TextEx
=====================================

Tired of spending hundreds of dollars on textbooks and only getting a tiny fraction of that back 
after reselling them to the bookstore?   Do not fret because the Text(book) Ex(change) application 
is for you!  TextEx is a [Play](http://www.playframework.com/) application that facilitates the resale 
and purchase of used books directly between students by allowing sellers to post their wares and buyers 
to request specific products.  The actual sale is handled between the individuals which removes the 
bookstore as a middle man.  Now the seller gets 100% of the resale price and both parties can set 
their offer / request prices to match supply and demand.  The result?  More money stays in the hands
of the students!

For the developers, TextEx currently models the data types using 4 models.  The relationships between
these models may be seen in the graph below which uses Crow's Foot notation.
