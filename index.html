          <h3>Text Ex</h3>

<p>Tired of spending hundreds of dollars on textbooks and only getting a tiny fraction of that back after reselling them to the bookstore? Do not fret because the Text(book) Ex(change) application is for you! TextEx is a Play application that facilitates the resale and purchase of used books directly between students by allowing sellers to post their wares and buyers to request specific products. The actual sale is handled between the individuals which removes the bookstore as a middle man. Now the seller gets 100% of the resale price and both parties can set their offer / request prices to match supply and demand. The result? More money stays in the hands of the students!</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<h3>Work In Progress</h3>

<p>TextEx is still a work in progress and consequently, some features are not implemented or fully functional yet.  Here is a list of things that we wish to add to TextEx.</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish Book Info and My Offer / Request views.  They are currently just mock ups and are not functional.</li>
<li>Implement results sorting on the Browse Books page.  The buttons currently do not do anything.</li>
<li>Upload images when adding a book.  We want users to be able to upload a cover image of the book they are adding.</li>
<li>User profiles.  More support for user profiles and features like buyer feedback and ratings to help you determine if a seller (or buyer) is trustworthy.</li>
<li>Better support for undoing actions.  Accidentally deleted a book?  No worries, once this is implemented you will be able to undo your mistake with the click of a button.</li>
<li>More!  We can add features as requested by users.  To request a feature, please submit an <a href="https://github.com/christophertfoo/TextEx/issues">issue</a> describing your idea.</li>
